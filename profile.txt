Profiles
A profile is a script that runs when PowerShell starts. You can use a profile to customize your environment to, for example, change background colors and errors and do other types of customizations. PowerShell will apply these changes to each new session you start.

Profile types
PowerShell supports several profile files. You can apply them at various levels, as you see here:

Description	Path
All users, all hosts	$PSHOME\Profile.ps1
All users, current host	$PSHOME\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
Current user, all hosts	$Home[My ]Documents\PowerShell\Profile.ps1
Current user, current host	$Home[My ]Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
There are two variables here: $PSHOME and $Home. $PSHOME points to the installation directory for PowerShell. $Home is the current user's home directory.

Other programs also support profiles, like Visual Studio Code.

Create a profile
When you first install PowerShell, there are no profiles, but there is a $Profile variable. It's an object that points to the path where each profile to apply should be placed. To create a profile:

Decide the level on which you want to create the profile. You can run $Profile | Select-Object * to see the profile types and the paths associated with them.

Select a profile type and create a text file at its location by using a command like this one: New-Item -Path $Profile.CurrentUserCurrentHost.

Add your customizations to the text file and save it. The next time you start a session, your changes will be applied
