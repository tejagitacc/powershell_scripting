# powershell scripting

PowerShell scripting is the process of writing a set of statements in the PowerShell language and storing those statements in a text file.

The steps to automate your task usually include calls to cmdlets, functions, variables, and more. 
To store these steps, you'll create a file that ends in .ps1 and save it. 
You'll then have a script you can run

Terminology:
Before you start learning to script, let's get an overview of the features of the PowerShell scripting language:

#Variables. You can use variables to store values. You can also use variables as arguments to commands.
#Functions. A function is a named list of statements. Functions produce an output that display in the console. You can also use functions as input for other commands.
#Flow control. Flow control is how you control various execution paths by using constructs like If, ElseIf, and Else.
#Loops. Loops are constructs that let you operate on arrays, inspect each item, and do some kind of operation on each item. But loops are about more than array iteration. You can also conditionally continue to run a loop by using Do-While loops. For more information, see About Do.
#Error handling. It's important to write scripts that are robust and can handle various types of errors. You'll need to know the difference between terminating and non-terminating errors. You'll use constructs like #Try and Catch. We'll cover this topic in the last conceptual unit of this module.
#Expressions. You'll frequently use expressions in PowerShell scripts. For example, to create custom columns or custom sort expressions. Expressions are representations of values in PowerShell syntax.
#.NET and .NET Core integration. PowerShell provides powerful integration with .NET and .NET Core. This integration is beyond the scope of this module.
